## How to Use
The entire repository will be needed on the specific host to run. This is as a result of the utility functions required by some of the scripts. 

In all cases the scripts can be invoked the usual way via `.\<script_name>`. The exception to this are planting the file artifacts. In this case one needs to run the [file-artifacts.ps1](./files/file-artifacts.ps1) script to plant the desired files on the system: `.\files\file-artifacts.ps1`.
